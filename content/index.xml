KPIPs should be used for significant user-facing or cross-cutting changes, not minor incremental improvements. When in doubt, if a committer thinks a change needs a KPIP, it does.
What is a KPIP? A KPIP is similar to a product requirement document commonly used in product management.</description></item><item><title>Kyuubi Version Control System</title><link>https://kyuubi.apache.org/version_control.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyuubi.apache.org/version_control.html</guid><description>Overview The Kyuubi source code resides in the Apache git repository, and available from here: https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=incubator-kyuubi.git
